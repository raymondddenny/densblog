Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Denny Raymond, a software engineer with a passion for building things that help people. I'm currently working as a software engineer in a digital consultant company.

I love to learn new things, and I'm always up for a challenge. I'm also a foodie, and my favorite food is Bakso (meat balls from Indonesia).
