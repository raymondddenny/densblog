## The Problem I Wanted to Solve

Job hunting is stressful enough without the chaos of managing applications across spreadsheets, notes, and random browser tabs. I've been there — losing track of which companies I applied to, forgetting to follow up, and scrambling before interviews because I couldn't find my notes.

Most tools out there are either too simple (just a list) or way too complicated (enterprise recruitment software). I wanted something in between — **simple structure, real clarity, no distractions**.

So I built [JobSuite](https://jobsuiteapp.com/).

## What JobSuite Does

JobSuite is a job application tracking tool designed for people who want to stay organized without the overhead. Here's what it helps with:

### 📋 Track Job Applications
Keep all your applications in one clean dashboard. No more scattered spreadsheets or messy note apps. Just a clear view of where things stand.

### ✍️ Smart Cover Letter Generation
Generate tailored cover letters for each role in seconds using AI. It's not about replacing your voice — it's about giving you a solid starting point.

### 🎯 Interview Preparation
Get personalized interview guides for the roles you apply to. Walk into interviews feeling prepared, not panicked.

## Who It's Built For

- **Job seekers** looking for their next role
- **Career changers** exploring new opportunities  
- **Freelancers** managing multiple applications
- **Anyone tired of messy spreadsheets**

If you're managing your own applications or freelance opportunities, this tool is for you.

## The Tech Behind It

Built with a modern stack focused on speed and reliability:

- **Supabase** for authentication and database
- **Google Sign-In** for seamless onboarding
- **OpenRouter** for AI content generation
- **Cloudflare** for security and bot protection
- **Polar** for payment processing
- **Fly.io** for hosting

Security was a priority — all data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest via Supabase.

## The Business Model

I kept it simple:

- **Free to start** — new users get 10 free credits, no credit card required
- **Pay as you go** — when credits run out, purchase more anytime
- **No subscriptions** — just buy what you need

Credits are used for AI features like cover letter generation, interview guides, and professional avatars.

## What I Learned Building This

1. **Focus beats features** — It's tempting to add everything, but the best products do a few things really well
2. **Solve your own problem** — Building something you'd actually use makes every decision clearer
3. **Ship early** — Getting it in front of real users taught me more than months of planning

## Try It Out
