## purposed
Hei There, nice to meet you all. Finally I have a place to share my thoughts and ideas after soooooooooo long time :p. Writing is really not my strength, i usually like to remember things, but realized
that writing is a way to remember things better, so I decided to start writing, hope i can be consistent for this :D.

## what's next
Sooo, i will write a lot about the new tech that interest me, like currently i'm learning about the AI with my basic in programming.
I will also write about the projects that i'm working on, and the things that i'm learning.
Also maybe share a thought about my daily life too hehehe.
Hope this will be useful for you all üòÅ.


**P.S.** follow me on [Twitter](https://x.com/raymonddenny14) & [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@dennyraymond?hl=en) i like to share or reshare info also there.

## wrap it up
That's all for now, see you next time.
